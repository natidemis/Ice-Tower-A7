-Remember to use the super jump feature or if you are running at the highest velocity you jump higher alot of the core gameplay revolves around that fact.
-we have a functional sprite system that shows diffrent states depending on what the player is doing so try it.
-the game dosent start until your first jump.
-there is a cheat in the game (Numpad key 9) that allows you to see higher floors if you cant reach them yourself
-the difficulty curve is centered around how high you reach. 
    - there is a max length value for platforms that changes every 50 floors ontop of them scaling randomly before that so check it out.
    - the floor tiles change every 100 floors 
    - use the cheat key if you want to see them all and the scaling
-functioning highscore system that saves in the browser.
-character select screen the ESC key can put you back on the main menu screen.
-sounds that play depending on diffrent factors ( music can be muted by pressing M, and SFX by pressing N)

TIP: jumping from side to side while swapping between pressing A and D as you collide with the wall can get you results fast as far as gameplay goes.
